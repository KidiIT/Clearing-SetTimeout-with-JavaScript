 Futhermore,the following will explain and give you an indepth understanding and knowledge about this project and how to use it at your various places of work.

How to use and the purpose of this project:

4: After which, link your Js.file with your html file. then use an attribute selector to make it more easier for you to get your elements to your Js.file at once. as seen on my time.js file. moreover, if you're new to programming then you've nothing to worry about because I'll stick with you throughout this project or problem solving because it's a very tricky one to work on alone. so stay tuned for more updates on what to do next.
